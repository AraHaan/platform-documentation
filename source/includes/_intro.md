<aside class="notice">
    We are committed to ensuring continued access to the Patreon API. Existing
    API functionality will continue to be supported and maintained, and where
    needed, we will work to achieve and maintain parity with growing data and
    feature functionality in the Patreon product. Although we will continue to
    provide select support and ongoing maintenance of the API, we will have
    limited capacity in the near term to respond to questions through the
    developer forum. For any questions about how to best access or leverage the
    Patreon API, please refer to the following resources:
