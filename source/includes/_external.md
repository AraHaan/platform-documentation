# External Services
We have an ever expanding set of external services that enable creators to manage and reward patrons in a flexible way.

## Zapier
Zapier is an automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Slack, MailChimp, and over 750 more. You can use the Patreon Zapier plugin to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

It's perfect for many of the use cases that would ordinarily require webhooks and has an ever expanding set of use cases.
