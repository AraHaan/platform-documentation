# Introduction
Welcome to the Patreon Platform! Get familiar with the Patreon platform products and tools using the tutorials and references below.

Please note: almost all of this documentation is geared towards software developers. If any of it is confusing, please contact us at [platform@patreon.com](mailto:platform@patreon.com).

While the Platform and this documentation are primarily geared towards developers for now, we do plan to have some more plug-n-play solutions in the coming months. Please contact [platform@patreon.com](mailto:platform@patreon.com) with any tips about how we can help you.

<aside class="notice">The Patreon Platform is new, and still under heavy development. Please check back frequently for new functionality, bug fixes, and other API changes.</aside>
