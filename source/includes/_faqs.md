## Testing
Testing of the API can be done by creating dummy accounts through the website. To test pledging, it can be useful to:


1. Create a Patreon account with creator page and set it to "per post".
2. Create another Patreon account and use it to pledge to the first account's page. A "per post" pledge will not incur any payments as long as it is cancelled before the end of the month.
3. Use the API as needed.
