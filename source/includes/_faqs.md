## Testing

Testing of the API can be done by creating dummy accounts through the website. To test pledging, it can be useful to:

1. Create a Patreon account with creator page and set it to "per post".
2. Create another Patreon account and use it to pledge to the first account's page. A "per post" pledge will not incur any payments as long as it is cancelled before the end of the month.
3. Use the API as needed.

    Unfortunately, at this time, we do not offer a separate testing/sandbox API.

## Accessibility

Patreon is committed to providing accessible websites to all of our users, and to becoming WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant. See our [accessibility page](https://www.patreon.com/policy/accessibility) for more information.

Patreon encourages developers to follow best practices in designing and building apps that are accessible, and which adhere to the Guidelines established by the [Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/wai).

We sometimes link to other sites and provide features built by our users or by third party developers. These parties are not vendors to Patreon, and are not paid by us for their content. We have no control over the accessibility of the content, features, or apps third parties may build using our API, and we are not responsible for their providing inaccessible tools.
